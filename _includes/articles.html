<h2>Research</h2>

Because Jekyll and kramdown do not support citations (at least not natively),
my research articles are written in Pandoc markdown and built with a very simple
shell script. Before pushing to GitHub, I refresh my Zotero bibliography, export
it to `/assets/bib/references.bib` and then run `/scripts/article-md-to-html.sh`.
The various Pandoc extensions are invoked within this script. As works-in-
progress, the articles are unstyled (expect with some minimal CSS to keep image
sizes reasonable.

<ul>
{% for article in site.articles %}
	<li>
		<a href="{{ article.url }}">{{ article.title }}</a> ({{ article.keywords | join: ", "}})
	</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
