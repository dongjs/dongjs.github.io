My site is back (after a long hiatus)!

The same:

- GitHub Pages
- Blog
- MathJax
- CV (updating it is my next TODO)
- Some poetry

Different:

- gh-pages themes! (the excellent Cayman)
- Jekyll running on WSL (Windows 10 people: do your research or you could have serious headaches)
- Using Jekyll collections for the first time, to make an article class
- Sharing my dissertation publicly (in progress)
- Computer Modern typeface
- Footnotes and various other elements inspired by Chris Olah's blog
- Links to React.js projects (being able to deploy to gh-pages is awesome)

Historically, the best antidote (for me) against writing procrastination is to
make it public. Here goes!
