It seems like no matter how  
carefully you choose your words,  
they always end up getting twisted  
by others. Choose your words, think  
carefully, and then speak up  
your thoughts. Only advice is   
to stay aware, listen carefully,  
and yell for help if  
you need Judy Blume it seems  
like no matter how carefully you choose  
your words, they always end  
up getting twisted by others. Nah,  
pick your battles carefully. Friends,  
I want to point out, not all  
of my tweets are goofy or silly or  
lighthearted. When I put up NSFW or a red  
flag, click carefully. She says "I will  
carefully do my best with every  
part of my personality." Good  
evening - drive carefully! - xxx  
Sometimes when I see guys in cut-  
off shirts I imagine them sitting  
at their kitchen table, care-  
fully cutting the shirt and I can't  
not laugh / just carefully explained  
(to me) what mansplaining is. *hides  
in the bushes realizing that you  
are not following me I creep  
closer and look at you carefully*   
"Today I'm giving my heart to you,  
please carefully handle it. Not   
because it's my heart, but because  
you're inside it." It seems like  
no matter how carefully you choose   
your words, they always end  
up getting twisted by others.  
â€“Ernest Hemingway.  
I like to listen. I have learned  
a great deal from listening carefully.  
Most people never listen. Of course it was / I  
choose my tunes carefully. I'm not  
some drugged up raver. I sit on the sofa,  
listening carefully to what you're saying
