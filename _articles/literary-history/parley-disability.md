## Introduction

*Already written; revise and make it fit with outline. This section needs to inform the reader about who Peter Parley was and what archive will be used to animate him.*

## "He ain't Peter Parley"

*This section connects Goodrich's own disability and representational networks with the afterlives of the Parley character and its distributors.*

**Plan**
- A trip to the South; footnoting the engravers
- Goodrich's story in letters 34, 35; importance of Crusoe
- The "Parley" name and brand; Hannah More as model; More's interest in Cogswell (166)
- Back to the source: brother and friend
- "Advances in Education" recalled; the central role of Woodbridge et al.
- Robert Merry and Abbott's general
- Connection to discourse of 19C sentimentality and sick children

The reason Samuel Goodrich could not be Peter Parley, according to the young boy in Savannah, was that "he hasn't got his foot bound up, and he don't walk with a crutch!" So great was the boy's dismay that he told his grandfather he wouldn't have "any thing to do with that man." [@GoodrichRecollectionslifetimeMen1857, 323] Goodrich tells this anecdote in Letter 50 of his *Recollections*, in which he makes a trip through the South. The trip culminates in a public reception in New Orleans in March of 1846 at which Goodrich is toasted by the leading lights of the city's lyceum. Domestic travel presents Goodrich, now 52, with first-hand evidence of his character's popularity. Both adults and children welcome him "under the name of the fictitious hero whom I had made to tell my stories": "Mr. Goodrich, or, as we all love to call you, Peter Parley..." (324) While the lyceum speechifying that Goodrich packages up in the letter traffics in the old ideas of character as a way for authors to inculcate good morals and in doing so live on after death, Goodrich hints at a more complex situation. At times, he admits, he "underwent rather sharp cross-questioning": "I, who had undertaken to teach truth, was forced to confess that fiction lay at the foundation of my scheme! My innocent young readers, however, did not suspect me: they had taken all I had said as positively true, and I was of course Peter Parley himself." (322) Goodrich dramatizes an interrogation scene in Mobile, Alabama, in which he owns up to an eight-year-old girl that he has not, in point of fact, been in prison in Africa or even in Africa at all.

The eight-year-old girl's quiz about the reliability of *Tales about Africa* and the young boy's aversion to the crutchless Goodrich represent two different kinds of truth-seeking behavior, conditioned by age.^[*Tales about Africa* was the third of Goodrich's initial six Parley books. It was first published in 1829.] On one view, widely represented in the scholarship on children's literature, growing out of what Goodrich calls the "innocent young reader" stage means learning to take pleasure in one's ability to switch between the fictional and the real, not in fantasy itself. But the juxtaposed reactions of Goodrich's southern readers point to a different economy of character, one in which consistency and availability rather than a bright line dviding truth from fiction are paramount.^[See Crain, Lesnik-Oberstein, Sanchez-Eppler, Berube.] Because Goodrich writes in the "useful and entertaining knowledge" genre, the plausibility of his travel writing depends in large part upon how he manages that genre's norms of textual compilation and reuse. A first-person serialized narrator like Parley presents certain difficulties. It's easy for a virtualized editorial voice to craft magazine issues out of natural-historical dispatches from all over the world. Making one character responsible for *all* the facts and adventures pushes beyond the limits of plausibility. As a result, the facts may come to be seen in a less factual light. Goodrich, "who had undertaken to teach truth," is uneasy about these effects.

Disability can be read as addressing this problem by widening the gap between the situation of a tale's recounting and the notional context in which it took place. 

But character was also, perhaps primarily, an effect of visual representation. Goodrich footnotes the boy's exclamation that "he ain't Peter Parley."

> The little book entitled "*Parley's Method of Telling about Geography to Children*," had a picture, drawn by Tisdale, representing Parley sitting in a chair, with his lame foot bound up, and a crutch at his side, while he is saying to the boys around--"Take care, don't touch my gouty toe; if you do, I won't tell you any more stories!" Of this work two millions were sold, and of course Parley and his crutch were pretty generally associated together, in the minds of children. (323-324n.)

## TODO

- Complete outline
- Decide on sources
- Define what I mean by disability
- Contrast physical to mental impairment in Goodrich's world (the list of narrators with mental disability in modernist fiction is huge)
