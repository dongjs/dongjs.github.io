Cuts and questions and "here is a picture": these are my subject.

Bewick and Goodrich in their memoirs both express as dissatisfaction with the state of children's literature. Work outwards from the memoirs.

Did the speedup of narrated literary time over the past three centuries have visual analogues? When we consider historical change in the printed *mise en page*, one counterpart phenomenon stands out. Early nineteenth-century wood engravings--especially the popular "vignette" form--were understood by readers as marking a shift in reading's media format and temporality. The career of Samuel Griswold Goodrich, instigator of the short-lived Boston Bewick Company, connects many of the actors and formats involved in this shift.

Ted Underwood has argued that changes in literary narration took place gradually. A representative 250 words of narration in an 18C novel will cover several years in time whereas by the 20C a passage of similar length will, on average, narrate just minutes.^[Underwood and two collaborators sampled 90 novels.] [@UnderwoodWhyLiteraryTime2018]

Here's what I have in my notes about Goodrich and Bewick:

Bewick illustrated a Newcastle (?) edition of Newtonian System:

Most accurate info is at Bewick Society website. It seems that Bewick owned a copy of Tom Telescope but probably did not illustrate an edition. Pearson has incorrect information.
