Wimsatt's assumption is that practice and theory of both the past and the present are integrally related-that there is a continuity in the materials of criticism-that a person who studies poetry today has a critical concern, not merely a historical interest, in what Aristotle or Plato said about poetry. He regards the great perennial problems of criticism as arising not by the whim of a tolerantly pluralist choice, but from the nature of language and reality. With profoun.},

  isbn = {978-0-691-17343-6 978-0-691-16062-7},
  shorttitle = {Forms},
  abstract = {"Forms offers a powerful new answer to one of the most pressing problems facing literary, critical, and cultural studies today--how to connect form to political, social, and historical context. Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only works of art but also political life--and our attempts to know both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling, forms shape every aspect of our experience. But forms don't impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes, patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding, generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in literary and cultural studies. Borrowing the concept of "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the specific ways that four major forms--wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks--have structured culture, politics, and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel Foucault, Jacques Ranci{\`e}re, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler, and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects, from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles's Antigone and the television series The Wire. The result is a radically new way of thinking about form for the next generation and essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of form and context"--},

"From a certain angle, the romantic machine might still be seen as the embodiment of instrumental rationality, as an agent of the deadening and alienating routines of modern life. Yet from other angles--as explored throughout this book--it was imbued with the aesthetics and the affects of the organic, the vital, and even the transcendent." (12)

Difference between classical "clockwork" machines and romantic machines (steam, electricity, other "subtle forces")

the new operators and scientists were concerned with "remaking the world" (6) through the cosmograms created by the new machines; these material assemblies reflected or proposed representations of the cosmos and potential ways for human and non-humans to live together beneficially

"Consigned to the margins of the text in stray references, India emerges as a suggestive and pliable symbol, one that registers the enormous profits being generated by the East Indies trade in this era and hints at the contours of the imperial ambitions of a young nation that had itself barely shaken off the yoke of British colonialism. A symptomatic reading of the silences and elisions surrounding India reveals how it represents a determinate absence in these novels (and by extension in the discursive system of the early Republic), which is at the core of gender and national identity issues\textemdash{}something which has yet to be sufficiently explored within American studies scholarship."
