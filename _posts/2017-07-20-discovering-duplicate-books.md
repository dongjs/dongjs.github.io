title: Discovering Duplicate Books with illustra-ligner
---

DRAFT

Stopping to describe what it is I'm doing is one of the ways to keep the research process on-track and enjoyable.

As I return to the `illustra-ligner` project and convert those tools to work with the HathiTrust APIs (next step: build my own book image API, perhaps in collaboration with HTRC), the research rewards are becoming clear. Working with a dataset of all the search results for "Peter Parley" from 1827-1855, patterns of outright reuse and repackaging are obvious.

This emergence is first of all a result of what I have been calling visual search. That is, I cluster all the extracted image details from the Parley dataset and start looking at them. Literally randomly. I pause on a particular set of neighbors: the source image is a jungle scene with reptiles. There are four copies of it.
