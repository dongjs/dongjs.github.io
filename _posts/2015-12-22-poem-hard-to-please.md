I do not like how big  
space is.  

But I'd also  
not like if space  
were small. There is  
  
no pleasing me.  

I'm terrified both  
of death and drifting  
  
(through space, for all  
eternity),  
  
there's just no pleasing me.  

*

How BIG space is I do not like,  
but neither would I like, at all,  
if space were small. There is, you see,  
  
no pleasing me. And terrorized  
still by death, I drift through space  
as one not pleased, nor pleasing,  
nor at rest.  

*

How has the space between us  
grown this big? I'm starting to  
get a bit worried.  
  
But I don't like how you   
always make me feel  
so small.  
  
Please, like anyone could fix it.

Perpetual stuck-ness, perpetual motion,  
it's known from certain laws of conservation  
  
that were I to achieve whichever  
I'd still remain attracted to the other.  

*

Nothing is big and I really don't like it,  
but a too small nothing can't fit my shit.  
  
Scared to die but afraid to go on,  
hope we all get pleased in the next one.
