# About this site

This site is modeled on Chris Olah's [blog](http://colah.github.io/). It uses:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) (3.3.7) for HTML/CSS
styling
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/usage/) for syntax highlighting of code
snippets
- The [Computer Modern](https://github.com/joehalliwell/joehalliwell.github.io/tree/master/res/cmun-serif)
typeface, compiled by Joe Halliwell from the [Unicode fonts](http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/)
created by Andrey V. Panov. For a history of Donald Knuth's work on Computer
Modern in the early 1990s, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern).
