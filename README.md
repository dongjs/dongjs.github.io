About me
========

I am a graduate student in [English (PhD, 2019)] and [Computer Science (MS, 2018)] at Yale University.

Currently, I'm the course manager and teaching fellow for [CPSC 201], "Introduction to Computer Science."

My hometown is Schenectady, NY.


About this site
===============

This site is built with [Jekyll]. Unfortunately, static site generation is difficult using the Windows 10 subsystem for Linux (WSL). At least for the moment, developing with [Hakyll] or managing Ruby with `rbenv` is difficult.

I recommend signing up for fast Insider Preview builds and following Dave Rupert's [guide]. You will need to do all of this with `root` permissions (I have not been able to find a way around this).

Adam Pritchard maintains a handy [Markdown guide].

I also plan on deploying several React.js projects to this site. Once again, WSL is causing complications with [nvm].

The lesson, as always, is search around for potential bugs before launching into a new workflow!
