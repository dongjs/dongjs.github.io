## Overview

This document is a glossary of technical terms encountered in my research. The goal is to provide historical and comparative context. It is organized alphabetically under larger categories. Where an outside resource is more helpful, the entry will simply point to it. The focus of this glossary is on terms related to image-making.


## Illustrations

The standard reference on how to identify prints is Gascoigne. [TODO: cite]
