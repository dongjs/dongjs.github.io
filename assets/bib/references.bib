  shorttitle = {Forms},
  abstract = {"Forms offers a powerful new answer to one of the most pressing problems facing literary, critical, and cultural studies today--how to connect form to political, social, and historical context. Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only works of art but also political life--and our attempts to know both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling, forms shape every aspect of our experience. But forms don't impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes, patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding, generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in literary and cultural studies. Borrowing the concept of "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the specific ways that four major forms--wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks--have structured culture, politics, and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel Foucault, Jacques Ranci{\`e}re, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler, and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects, from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles's Antigone and the television series The Wire. The result is a radically new way of thinking about form for the next generation and essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of form and context"--},

"From a certain angle, the romantic machine might still be seen as the embodiment of instrumental rationality, as an agent of the deadening and alienating routines of modern life. Yet from other angles--as explored throughout this book--it was imbued with the aesthetics and the affects of the organic, the vital, and even the transcendent." (12)

Difference between classical "clockwork" machines and romantic machines (steam, electricity, other "subtle forces")

the new operators and scientists were concerned with "remaking the world" (6) through the cosmograms created by the new machines; these material assemblies reflected or proposed representations of the cosmos and potential ways for human and non-humans to live together beneficially

"Consigned to the margins of the text in stray references, India emerges as a suggestive and pliable symbol, one that registers the enormous profits being generated by the East Indies trade in this era and hints at the contours of the imperial ambitions of a young nation that had itself barely shaken off the yoke of British colonialism. A symptomatic reading of the silences and elisions surrounding India reveals how it represents a determinate absence in these novels (and by extension in the discursive system of the early Republic), which is at the core of gender and national identity issues\textemdash{}something which has yet to be sufficiently explored within American studies scholarship."

  abstract = {In 1832, several British periodicals surfaced with the advent of new print technologies. Sponsored by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Charles Knight created and published one of the first cheap periodicals for the masses, The Penny Magazine (1832\textendash{}1845). Knight has been studied for his contributions to publishing history, but not for his specific attention to animals. Using state-of-the-art print technologies, the journal fused picture and word to create a respectable publication that used natural history to entice subscribers. Reading about animals in The Penny Magazine was both entertaining and educational. Pet keeping was emerging as synonymous with middle-class status, and some animals were valued as companions and curiosities. In the early nineteenth century, most illustrated zoology texts came from naturalists who had circumnavigated the globe in search of new species. These books contained lavishly detailed lithographic prints, but the weekly Penny Magazine provided richly engraved woodcuts of the same topics and it was accessible and affordable. Knight's journal shows a fascination with exotic and domestic species that can clearly be seen through the copious illustrations and articles. The periodical reveals animals in scientific as well as emotional states, paralleling the duality of thought emerging at the end of the Romantic era. Knight also used animals to define the conditions of the working classes and to suggest progress through commercial enterprises and personal awareness. The journal also introduced readers to the importance of the environment and the need for stewardship when collecting and housing animals. Clearly Knight used zoology as a tool for motivating autodidactic learning, urging the working-class to develop moral behavior, and for encouraging subscriptions. We can also find Knight's respect for all living beings in his effort to correctly portray animals and create an understanding of their importance to society. A variety of relationships between human and animal are portrayed: from the political to the humane, and from the curious to the exploitation of foreign and domestic creatures. Ultimately, The Penny Magazine represents early nineteenth-century efforts to disseminate zoological information that contributed to a future cultural understanding and ethical consideration of animals.},

What scholarship there has been has insisted that scientific part-works operated on entirely different principles from the strategies for maintaining readerly interest that were being developed by serial novelists like Charles Dickens. Deploying the methods of book history, this essay examines the reporting of Richard Owen's celebrated paleontological reconstructions from the 1830s and 1840s in the serialized formats of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, his own History of British Fossil Mammals, and, in particular, the Penny Cyclopaedia. It argues that Owen, along with his close friend William John Broderip, clearly recognized the affective possibilities of the serial format and that they exploited the Penny Cyclopaedia's sequential mode of publication to evoke suspense and expectation in their anonymous but collaboratively authored accounts of Owen's paleontological researches.},

Their influence upon British geography teaching has, however, been little explored, despite the work already done on the general impact of Pestalozzianism and Fellenbergianism on British education. Using the arguments of nineteenth-century educational theorists such as Compayre and Spencer, this study argues that Pestalozzian educationists such as Phillip Pullen and Charles Mayo in England helped to change the way that geography was taught to middle-class children. A case study of teaching practices at a Pestalozzian institution in Worksop, Nottinghamshire shows how changes in geographical education were encouraged by Pestalozzian ideas on the teaching of geography and the relationship of the subject to other disciplines including topography, natural history and geology.},
