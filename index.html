<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>I am a graduate student in English (PhD, 2019) and Computer Science (MS, 2018) at Yale University. This site contains my blog and live drafts of my current research projects. As a literary historian, I study how "practical education" and mass-produced media shaped each other in the early nineteenth century. Within computer science, I'm interested in techniques for extracting and clustering historical book illustrations. I am the course manager for CPSC 201 and enjoy functional programming and software-based art projects.</p>

<p>Feel free to write me at firstname dot lastname at yale dot edu. This is what I look like.</p>
