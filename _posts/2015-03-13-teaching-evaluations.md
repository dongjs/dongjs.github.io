title: Learning from Teaching Evaluations
---

Due to an application for another teaching fellow position, I had occasion to go back and look at my evaluations from TF-ing in the fall. The course was Brian Walsh's "Shakespeare: Histories and Tragedies." The evaluations were positive in a qualified way and contained many well-deserved suggestions for improvement. No lie, it's tough to read anonymous, honest comments about the weaknesses of your own teaching style. I'm glad that this was my first course as a TF and I now have feedback for improving those aspects and growing stronger in my areas of strength. Here are some action points based on those comments.

- **Don't undermine your own authority.** My department assigns TF positions
somewhat arbitrarily and I remarked in passing during section that I had less
expertise in Shakespeare/theater than in American Lit (my specialty). Bad idea!

- **Always deliver a takeaway.** While conversation by and among *students* is
the goal of section, they still need to leave feeling as if they learned
something. I always prepared topics but needed to prioritize going over at least
one of those topics, rather than letting the discussion flow freely but with
less structure.

- **Prevent discussion monopolies.** Two students commented on imbalances in who did the talking during section. Over the semester, I used cold calling more often, but good balance flows out of having clear goals (see previous point) so that students of varying interest and background knowledge feel equally comfortable contributing.

- **Always return materials when you say you will.** No excuse for this. Even a
couple of days matters.

- **Don't give differential effort.** It's perhaps human nature to be more alert
when being observed, but I am striving to be the kind of teacher who gives the
same (high!) level of effort in all situations.

On the positive side:

> Stephen was a great TA!

> [Stephen] made section fun and useful and sections at Yale are never fun or useful.

> Stephen was a highly accessible and approachable section leader, making reviewing those essays an easy task.

> Stephen was especially interested in a historical understanding of Shakespeare, and I really appreciated that he brought in excerpts from outside sources to help us better understand the plays. He was very helpful in meetings, and is generally such a chill guy--the best combination you could ask for in a TA.

> Stephen was an effective TA--warm and thoughtful. He did a great job bringing interesting and often unexpected outside materials into section.

Oh, and I should note that my professor's main constructively-critical tip was
to watch out for mumbling! Got it. Loud and clear. Can't wait to improve all
these areas the next time I TF.

Currently, I'm co-teaching a seminar entitled "The Grid: Data, History,
Visualization" and it's going amazingly well. I feel an ownership in the content
and thus am fully engaged. But being a good teacher means a commitment to effort
and excellence in all situations.
