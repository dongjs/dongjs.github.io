OH, WOW!
========

Jekyll is fun. I just got it up and running on my skeleton blog. I'm using the docs at [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and [Adam Pritchard's](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) helpful Markdown syntax.

More to come soon!
