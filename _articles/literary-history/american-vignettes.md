Cuts and questions and "here is a picture": these are my subject. 

Did the speedup of narrated literary time over the past three centuries have visual analogues? When we consider historical change in the printed *mise en page*, one counterpart phenomenon stands out. Early nineteenth-century wood engravings--especially the popular "vignette" form--were understood by readers as marking a shift in reading's media format and temporality.
