This Rap shows me many things.  
Hurt is the first feeling I get,   
dedicated to the simple melodic tones.  
Second, I get anger based  

in hurt. Is the first feeling I get  
one of pride, or yet tradition?  
This second time I get anger based  
thirdly in desperation and  

in pride. Yet tradition  
in the Hook means, truly, capitalism!  
Thirdly, I get desperation and  
next I hear what seems to me to be  

in the Hook a Minstrel capitalism!  
Quiet longing for what should have been.  
Next I hear what seems to me to be  
(but what could never have been  

quite) longing for what should have been,  
based on the lies of society and  
what could never have but been.  
Finally I hear and feel acceptance,  

based on the lies of society.  
And in that last string---    
I finally hear and feel acceptance,  
parting with the fabric of what these men held  

in that last string  
so close yet let go of,  
a parting with the fabric of what these men held  
to gain what they feel they needed.  

So close yet let go of:  
dedicated to the simple melodic tones  
to gain what they feel they needed.  
This Rap shows me many things.
